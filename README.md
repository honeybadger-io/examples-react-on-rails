# Honeybadger on React on Rails

> [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io) is a badass error monitoring service for full stack web apps.

> [React on Rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) integrates Rails with (server rendering of) Facebook's React front-end framework.

**Honeybadger on React on Rails** provides a simple example of how to integrate
Honeybadger with React on Rails to unlock Universal (Isomorphic) error
reporting in your React-based Rails apps.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with this application is to deploy it to Heroku
with the Heroku Button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Using that button will spin up a Heroku app for you with the Honeybadger
add-on already added to the app.

## Slightly Less Quick Start

The rest of this README is forthcoming.
